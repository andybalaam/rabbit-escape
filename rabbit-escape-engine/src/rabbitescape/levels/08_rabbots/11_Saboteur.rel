:hint.1=Get the rabbot to take out the rabbit at the bottom.
:hint.2=Bridge the rabbot at the end of the top platform, and when it hit the block and begins to turn to the right, make it dig.
:hint.3=Place a bash token where the rabbot lands to bash through the slope to take out the rabbit.  Bash the rabbits at the top to release them.
