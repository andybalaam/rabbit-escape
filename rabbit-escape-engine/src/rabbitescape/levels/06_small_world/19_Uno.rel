:hint.1=Get rid of that block in front of the entrance, and get over to the other side.  Use pause to make the quick timing easier.
:hint.2=Start by immediately bashing then bridging.  Give the second rabbit a brolly.  Find a way to stop the bridger, then turn your rabbits around into the exit.
:hint.3=Be fast at the start: quickly bash then bridge, then drop a brolly token on the entrance so it's picked up by the second rabbit.  Switch back and make the first rabbit a climber as it completes the first bit of bridge.  Dig one square to the right of the entrance, and turn the digger into a blocker.
