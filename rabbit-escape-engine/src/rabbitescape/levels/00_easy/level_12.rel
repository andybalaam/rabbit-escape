:hint1=Don't panic: you only need to save two! Focus on saving the first rabbit.
:hint2=Build a bridge from the bottom of the slope, and place another when the bridger is about to stop.
:hint3=Place a bridge token at the very bottom of the slope. After three squares, place another at end of the bridge.
